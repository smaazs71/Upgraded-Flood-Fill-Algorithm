# Upgraded-Flood-Fill-Algorithm
This Algorithm overcome the limitation of stack space in original Flood fill algorithm.
This Algorithm can fill large figures as it uses very less stack.
The working is similar to Flood fill algorithm.
Here instead of filling only the neighbouring pixels it fills all the pixels in its axis
and then call for the recursion for the neighbouring axis.
